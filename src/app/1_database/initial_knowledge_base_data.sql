## What is an AI Agent?
An AI agent is a system that can:
1. Perceive its environment
2. Make decisions
3. Take actions
4. Learn from outcomes

## Core Components
1. Perception System
2. Decision Engine
3. Action Framework
4. Learning Mechanism

## Implementation Patterns
```typescript
interface AIAgent {
  perceive(environment: Environment): Perception;
  decide(perception: Perception): Decision;
  act(decision: Decision): Action;
  learn(outcome: Outcome): void;
}
```

## Best Practices

  constructor() {
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
      tokensPerMinute: 10000
    });
  }

  async query(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    // Check cache
    if (this.cache.has(prompt)) {
      return this.cache.get(prompt)!;
    }

    // Rate limiting
    await this.rateLimiter.wait();

    // Make API call
    const response = await this.makeApiCall(prompt);

    // Cache result
    this.cache.set(prompt, response);

    return response;
  }
}
